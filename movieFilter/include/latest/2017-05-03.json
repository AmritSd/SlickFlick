Kishan cannot turn down his old friend’s request and Puja comes to live with Kishan’s family. At first country girl Puja is ill at ease in the huge mansion. She is befriended by Kishan’s son Rahul (Dev), who assures her that he has no romantic interest in her and that a boy and a girl can be platonic friends. The pair share outings and confidences and all seems to be going well. Then Rahul takes Puja to a party put on by some of his rich friends. They humiliate Puja and accuse her of scheming to marry Rahul. Puja leaves in tears and distances herself from Rahul. At that point, Rahul suddenly realizes that he has fallen in love with her. With aid of his mother (who likes the unassuming Puja) and his comic friend Manohar, Rahul sets out to win Puja’s heart.\r\nHe succeeds, but their romance is balked by Rahul’s father Kishan, who does not want his son to marry a poor nobody. He prepares to send Puja home in disgrace. At this unpropitious moment, Karan returns from overseas. Kishan accuses him of plotting to match Rahul and Puja. Karan and Kishan quarrel; Karan and Puja then return to their village.\r\nRahul refuses to accept the separation. He defies his father and is disinherited. He goes to Puja’s village and begs to be allowed to marry her. Karan, angered by Kishan’s accusations, says that he will allow the marriage on one condition: Rahul must prove that he can support a wife by his own efforts....Hide",
